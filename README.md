# Parallel Computing Project

This repository contains multiple approaches to matrix multiplication algorithms, including a parallel version, implemented in both C++ and TypeScript. Additionally, a report is available that provides comparisons of these methods.

The development of this program is part of the curriculum for the [Parallel and Distributed Computing]([https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520334](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=520333)) course.
